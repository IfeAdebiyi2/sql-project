# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, my goal was to analyze ecommerce data to glean insights on the relationship between customer behavior, products and sales performance.

## Process
### Step 1: Data collection and preparation
	-Extracted and imported collected data into database
	-Examined dataset consisting of 5 tables

### Step 2 : Data cleaning and transformation
	-Using SQL queries, normalized the dataset by removing irrelevant, redundant and duplicate data across columns.
	-Fix structural issues; converted datatypes of columns e.g from "varchar" to "numeric" to match values contained in rows.
	-Determined how to handle missing data & null values.

### Step 3 : Data Analysis
	-Use of several SQL queries to analyze cleaned dataset
	-Extract valuable insights from analysis results to answer questions

### Step 4 : Data Validation/QA
	-Check for missing values using assertions
	-Check for unique fields/duplicates


## Results
From analysis results, I extrapolated that on the average, more site visitors in the United States ordered products online during their browsing sessions compared to other countries.
By using browsing data, we can deduce how certain geographical locations influence revenue generation.

While the result set generated may have given some valuable insights, it is worthy to note that the dataset was largely of poor quality and may have also resulted in inaccurate deductions along the line.


## Challenges 
	-the sheer amount of time spent in cleaning and normalizing the data.
	-struggled with writing complex SQL queries
	-inability to extract more robust and complete results and therefore insights.

## Future Goals
	-spend a bit more time cleaning, normalizing and optimizing the data
	-possibly augment or update exisiting data to reduce null values
